country-data.org
================

Source code for the country-data.org site. Browse, search, and filter a vast amount of data from a number of different sources. Educate yourself about the world.

Current Status:
Vastly incomplete.

To Do:
------

At present, I'm working on parsing and importing data from the CIA World Factbook.
After that, I'll need to get display and browsing of data going.
After that, we'll need user-configurable filtering, without saved filters.
After that, we'll need the ability to authenticate users and save filters.
After that, we'll need to import data from other sources (starting with State Department Human Rights Report).
After that, we'll need to add the ability to share filters with other people.
After that, we'll need to add additional data sources (UN, UK, Canada, human rights groups, etc.)
