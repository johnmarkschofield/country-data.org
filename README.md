country-data.org
================

Source code for the country-data.org site. Browse, search, and filter a vast amount of data from a number of different sources. Educate yourself about the world.

Current Status:
Vastly incomplete.

To Do:
------

* <del>parse one field list page</del>
* <del>import one field list page to database</del>
* <del>Deal with country names with spaces</del>
* <del>Sort Country Names on country list page</del>
* <del>import all field list pages</del>
* <del>After that, I'll need to get display and browsing of data going.</del>
* Validate imported data -- what fields besides budget in Brazil are we missing? Fix missing/wrong fields.
* Skip importing duplicate data
* All data is being imported into string fields. We'll need to convert numerical data to numbers, etc.
* After that, we'll need user-configurable filtering, without saved filters.
* After that, we'll need the ability to authenticate users and save filters.
* After that, we'll need to import data from other sources (starting with State Department Human Rights Report).
* After that, we'll need to add additional data sources (UN, UK, Canada, human rights groups, etc.)
